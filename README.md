# tasks-vue
I started to follow the playlist (here)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hp28dYyYBy3xoOdoeNw-hD] to learn about vue and Pinia
about half way through I just started to do my own thing because I started to get the hang of it. The plan is to build the same thing in other
frontend frameworks/libraries to get my frontend skills up.
